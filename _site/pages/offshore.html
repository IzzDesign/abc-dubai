              <h3 class="deco">Why Choose to Establish Offshore Company in UAE</h3>
              <p>The United Arab Emirates have long-standing reputation of a solid and tax-free jurisdiction. Due to the compliance with all international requirements on anti-money laundering the UAE have never been black listed as a country failing to comply with such regulations. In spite ofthe absence of taxes, they were never considered by international anti-money laundering organizations as an offshore jurisdiction.</p>

              <p>UAE is not a dependent or 'overseas' territory of another country. Pressure has been put on traditional low tax jurisdictions by the Commission of the European Community (EU) in conjunction with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The UK parliament has converted British Dependent Territories to British 'Overseas' Territories (in 1998). The UK government may apply greater control over its tax haven progeny (ie Bermuda, BVI, Caymans, Gibraltar, Turks &nsp; Caicos)</p>

              <p>UAE has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with a number of countries Double taxation agreements prevent individuals and corporations from being susceptible to paying tax on the same item during the same time period. These agreements determine which of the two states concerned should levy tax in a particular situation: Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belorussia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Cyprus, Czech, Egypt, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Lebanon, Libya, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunis, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen.</p>

              <p>UAE is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) No foreign exchange of information. The UAE did not sign the directive and the agreement with the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). In relation to this fact the offshore companies registered in UAE today are ones of the most effective protection instruments of confidentiality and investors rights. In addition to it, the UAE has solid and stable banking system.</p>

              <p>UAE is not on the OECD 'blacklist' of tax havens (nor the FATF blacklist)</p>

              <p>UAE is not a member of the EU, and is not subject to EU regulation.</p>
